# Azure Key Vault
## Overview
Azure Key Vault is a cloud service that provides a secure store for secrets, keys, and certificates. It allows you to securely control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets used by cloud applications and services. Azure Key Vault simplifies the process of securely storing and managing these sensitive data while enabling stringent control over their distribution.

## Functionality
 - Secrets Management: Securely store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets.
 - Key Management: Create, import, and manage cryptographic keys and control their use across a wide range of Azure services.
 - Certificate Management: Provision, manage, and deploy public and private SSL/TLS certificates.
 - Secure Access: Authenticate access to Key Vault using Azure Active Directory.
 - Audit Logs: Monitor and audit key usage with Azure Monitor and Azure Log Analytics.

## Use Cases
 - Secure Application Secrets: Store credentials, connection strings, and other application secrets securely.
 - Data Encryption: Use keys managed by Key Vault for encrypting sensitive data.
 - Certificate Lifecycle Management: Automate the lifecycle of digital certificates.
 - Compliance Requirements: Meet compliance requirements related to key management and audit trails.
 - DevOps Security: Integrate with DevOps processes to secure CI/CD pipelines.

## Best Practices
1. Least Privilege Access: Implement least privilege access principles for Key Vault access policies.
2. Key Rotation: Regularly rotate keys and secrets for enhanced security.
3. Secure Access: Use Azure AD for authenticating and authorizing access to Key Vault.
4. Backup Keys and Secrets: Regularly back up keys and secrets stored in Key Vault.
5. Monitor and Audit: Enable logging and monitor access and usage of keys and secrets.
6. Centralize Management: Centralize the management of secrets and keys for your Azure environment.
7. API Integration: Integrate Key Vault with other Azure services and applications using REST APIs.
