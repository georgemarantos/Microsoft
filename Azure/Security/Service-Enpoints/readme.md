# Azure VNet Service Endpoints
## Overview
Azure Virtual Network (VNet) Service Endpoints extend your virtual network private address space and the identity of your VNet to Azure services, allowing you to secure your critical Azure service resources to only your virtual networks. Service endpoints provide optimal routing by always keeping traffic on the Microsoft Azure backbone network.

## Functionality
 - Secure Azure Service Resources: Secure Azure service resources to only your virtual networks.
 - Optimized Routing: Traffic from your VNet to Azure services always remains on the Microsoft Azure backbone network.
 - Improved Security: No public internet exposure for resources that are service-endpoint enabled.
 - Granular Access Control: Define access to Azure service resources based on the virtual network and subnet level.

## Use Cases
 - Enhanced Security: Secure critical Azure services like Azure Storage and SQL Database from unauthorized network access.
 - Optimized Network Flow: Leverage the Microsoft Azure backbone network for optimized routing of traffic.
 - Application Isolation: Isolate applications within VNets for security and compliance.
 - Hybrid Cloud Environments: Securely integrate Azure services into hybrid cloud deployments.

## Best Practices
1. Access Control Policies: Implement strict network access control policies for service resources.
2. Network Architecture Planning: Plan your network architecture to leverage service endpoints effectively.
3. Secure Services Integration: Integrate VNet service endpoints with Azure services for enhanced security.
4. Monitor Traffic Flow: Use Azure Network Watcher to monitor and log the traffic flow to service endpoints.
