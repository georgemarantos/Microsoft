# Azure Information Protection (AIP)
## Overview
Azure Information Protection (AIP) is a cloud-based solution that helps organizations classify, label, and protect documents and emails. It provides the ability to automatically classify and protect data based on sensitivity. AIP is integrated into Microsoft Office applications and extends to Microsoft 365 services, ensuring secure data handling and compliance across your organization.

## Functionality
 - Data Classification and Labeling: Classify and label data at the time of creation or modification.
 - Policy Enforcement: Implement policies to control access and usage of information.
 - Data Protection: Protect sensitive information through encryption, identity, and authorization policies.
 - Tracking and Reporting: Monitor data distribution and access, with detailed tracking and reporting features.
 - Secure Collaboration: Safely share protected files within and outside the organization.

## Use Cases
 - Protecting Sensitive Data: Secure confidential and business-critical data across various platforms.
 - Regulatory Compliance: Meet regulatory compliance requirements for data protection.
 - Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Prevent accidental data leaks and unauthorized access.
-  Cross-Platform Security: Extend protection across cloud services, mobile devices, and on-premises environments.
