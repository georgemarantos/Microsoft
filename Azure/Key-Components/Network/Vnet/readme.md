# Azure Virtual Networks (VNets)
## Overview
Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) enable Azure resources such as virtual machines (VMs) to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. VNets provide isolation and segmentation, facilitate private IP addresses, and offer a range of connectivity options including site-to-site VPNs, point-to-site VPNs, and ExpressRoute connections.

## Functionality
 - Isolation and Segmentation: Create isolated networks within Azure and segment them into subnets.
 - Interconnectivity: Connect VNets to each other, to on-premises networks, and to the internet.
 - Traffic Filtering and Routing: Control network traffic with Network Security Groups (NSGs), route tables, and service endpoints.
 - Integration with Azure Services: Seamlessly integrate with other Azure services like Azure Load Balancer and Application Gateway.
 - Secure Connectivity: Establish secure VPN or ExpressRoute connections for enhanced privacy and reliability.

## Use Cases
 - Secure and Isolated Environments: Create secure environments for your Azure services.
 - Hybrid Cloud Deployments: Connect on-premises data centers to Azure resources.
 - Microservice Architectures: Segment microservice-based architectures into subnets.
 - Multi-tier Applications: Separate tiers of multi-tier applications into different subnets.

## Best Practices
1. Network Security: Implement NSGs and Azure Firewall for robust network security.
2. Subnet Design: Plan subnets wisely to segregate different types of workloads.
3. Service Endpoints**: Utilize service endpoints for secure Azure service access.
5. **Routing: Configure effective routing strategies for optimal network performance.
6. Monitoring**: Monitor network performance and health with Azure Network Watcher.
