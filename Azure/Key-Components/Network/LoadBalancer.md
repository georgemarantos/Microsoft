# Azure Load Balancer
## Overview
Azure Load Balancer is a high-performance, scalable, and secure load balancer service built for the cloud. It ensures high availability and network performance for your applications by distributing incoming traffic among healthy service instances in cloud services or virtual machines.

## Functionality
 - **Layer-4 Load Balancing**: Provides high-performance and low-latency load balancing at layer 4 (TCP, UDP).
 - **Scalability**: Automatically scales with increasing traffic.
 - **Health Probes**: Monitors the health of application instances and only sends traffic to healthy instances.
 - **Port Forwarding**: Supports port forwarding for directing incoming traffic to a specific port on VMs.
 - **Zone-Redundant**: High availability across Availability Zones.

## Use Cases
 - **High Availability**: Distribute traffic across multiple VMs to ensure high availability of applications.
 - **Scalable Applications**: Scale applications in response to incoming traffic loads.
 - **Global Distribution**: Use in conjunction with Azure Traffic Manager for global traffic distribution.
 - **Network Security**: Implement secure and isolated networks for applications in Azure.
