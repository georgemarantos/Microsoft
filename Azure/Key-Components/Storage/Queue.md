# Azure Queue Storage
## Overview
Azure Queue Storage is a service for storing large numbers of messages that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via authenticated calls using HTTP or HTTPS. A single queue message can be up to 64 KB in size, and a queue can contain millions of messages, up to the total capacity limit of a storage account. This service is commonly used to create a backlog of work to process asynchronously.

## Functionality
 - Message Queuing: Store and retrieve messages between application components.
 - Scalability: Automatically scales to meet demand, handling millions of messages per day.
 - Decoupling: Decouple different parts of an application to increase reliability and scalability.
 - Accessibility: Accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP/HTTPS.
 - Security: Secure your data with encryption, access policies, and role-based access control.

## Use Cases
 - Asynchronous Processing: Queue messages for asynchronous processing.
 - Communication between Web and Worker Roles: Communicate between web roles and background worker roles in Azure.
 - Auto-Scaling: Implement auto-scaling in applications based on the queue length.
 - Order Processing: Use in scenarios like order processing where requests need to be processed in a specific sequence.

## Best Practices
1. Visibility Timeout: Use visibility timeout to prevent other consumers from processing the message again.
2. Message Size Limits: Keep the message size within the 64 KB limit.
3. Secure Access: Implement Shared Access Signature (SAS) for secure access to the queue.
4. Queue Monitoring: Monitor the length of the queue to trigger scaling operations.
5. Error Handling: Implement proper error handling for message processing.
6. Message TTL: Set an appropriate Time-To-Live (TTL) for messages.
7. Decoupling Components: Use queues to decouple application components for improved scalability and reliability.
