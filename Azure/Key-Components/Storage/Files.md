# Azure Files
## Overview
Azure Files offers fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry-standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. It provides shared access to files, allowing multiple VMs to access the same files with both read and write permissions. Azure Files can also be cached on Windows Servers with Azure File Sync for fast access near where the data is being used.

## Functionality
 - Fully Managed File Shares: Create and manage file shares in the cloud easily.
 - SMB and REST Protocols: Access files via SMB protocol or REST API.
 - Seamless Integration: Integrate with Azure services and on-premises servers.
 - Secure: Secure your data with advanced encryption, network security, and identity-based access controls.
 - Snapshot and Backup Support: Use file share snapshots for backup and recovery.

## Use Cases
 - Replace or Supplement On-Premises File Servers: Azure Files can be used to completely replace or supplement traditional on-premises file servers or NAS devices.
 - Lift and Shift Applications: Simplify the migration of on-premises applications to the cloud by eliminating the need to change or re-write code.
 - Simplify Cloud Development: Azure file shares can be seamlessly used with Azure App Service and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
 - Global File Sharing: Share files across global locations easily.

## Best Practices
1. Security: Implement strict access controls and use Azure Active Directory Domain Services for authentication.
2. File Sync: Use Azure File Sync to keep data synchronized and accessible from on-premises servers.
