# Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)
## Overview
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) simplifies deploying a managed Kubernetes cluster in Azure. It reduces the complexity and operational overhead of managing Kubernetes by offloading much of that responsibility to Azure. AKS is ideal for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes.

## Functionality
 - An enterprise-grade Kubernetes container orchestration service.

## Use Cases
 - Suited for modern, microservices-based applications and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows.
 - Machine Learning and AI: Facilitates machine learning workflows and AI-enabled applications.
 - Hybrid Cloud Scenarios: Supports hybrid cloud deployments in conjunction with Azure Stack.
