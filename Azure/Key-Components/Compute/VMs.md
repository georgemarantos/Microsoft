# Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)
## Overview
Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) offer scalable computing capabilities in the cloud. An essential component of Microsoft Azure, VMs provide the flexibility of virtualization without the need to buy and maintain physical hardware. They allow you to deploy a wide range of computing solutions in an agile way.

## Functionality
 - Provides scalable, on-demand virtualized servers.

## Use Cases
 - Ideal for hosting applications, websites, and services with complete control over the computing environment.
 - Development and Test Environments: Quickly set up and dismantle development and test environments, bringing new applications to market faster.
 - Data Processing: Use Azure VMs for data processing tasks like batch processing, data mining, and database operations.
 - Extended Datacenter: VMs act as an extension of an on-premises datacenter, offering more flexibility and scalability.
 - Disaster Recovery: Implement effective disaster recovery solutions in the cloud.
