# Azure Container Instances (ACI)
## Overview
Azure Container Instances (ACI) offers the simplest way to run containers in Azure. This service allows you to deploy and manage containers without the complexity of container orchestration. ACI is ideal for scenarios that can operate in isolated containers, including simple applications, task automation, and build jobs.

## Functionality
 - Provides containers 'as a service' with no need to manage the underlying VMs.
 - Rapid Deployment: Quickly start containers on-demand in a managed environment.
 - No Orchestration Required: Run containers without the need for Kubernetes or other orchestration systems.
 - Flexible Sizing: Choose the exact amount of memory and CPU needed for your container.
 - Integrated Security: Utilize Azure security features for secure and compliant container operations.
 - Persistent Storage Options: Attach Azure File Shares for persistent storage of container data.
 
## Use Cases
 - Perfect for short-term, data-processing jobs.
 - Application Testing: Rapidly deploy and test containerized applications.
 - Event-driven Applications: Use with Azure Logic Apps or Azure Functions for event-driven processing.
 - Simplified Microservices: Run small-scale microservices without complex orchestration.
