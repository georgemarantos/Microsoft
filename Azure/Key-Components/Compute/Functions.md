# Azure Functions
## Overview
Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables you to run event-triggered code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. It allows developers to focus on writing the code that runs their application, while Azure handles the scaling and infrastructure management.

## Functionality
 - An event-driven, serverless computing service.
 
## Use Cases
 - Web APIs: Build serverless APIs that scale with your application's needs.
 - Data Processing: Process data from Azure Event Hub, IoT devices, or Azure Storage.
 - Automation: Automate tasks in response to cloud events or webhook triggers.
 - Real-time Processing: Implement real-time data processing for streaming data.
