# Microsoft Azure
## Welcome
The following are notes taken as I prepared for my Microsoft certification as well as common scripts and tools that I use in the field.

## Overview
 Azure is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers. It provides a range of cloud services, including those for computing, analytics, storage, and networking. Users can pick and choose from these services to develop and scale new applications, or run existing applications, in the public cloud.
