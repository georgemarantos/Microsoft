## Remote Desktop Services
# Overview
Remote Desktop Services (RDS), formerly known as Terminal Services, is a role in Windows Server that provides technologies enabling users to access session-based desktops, virtual machine-based desktops, or applications in the data center from both inside a corporate network and from the Internet. RDS is crucial for facilitating remote work scenarios, offering a scalable, flexible, and centralized desktop and application deployment strategy.

# How It Functions:
1. <b>RD Session Host (RDSH):</b>
   - Hosts Windows-based programs or the full Windows desktop for Remote Desktop Services clients.
2. <b>RD Virtualization Host (RDVH):</b>
   - Enables virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), hosting virtual desktops.
3. <b>RD Connection Broker: </b>
   - Manages user connections to both RDSH and RDVH.
4. <b>RD Web Access:</b>
   - Allows users to access RDS applications and desktops via a web browser.
5. <b>RD Gateway:</b>
   - Enables authorized remote users to connect to resources on an internal corporate or private network from any Internet-connected device.
